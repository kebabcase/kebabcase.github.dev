This project was created with the intent to be used by Kalamazoo College as an official mobile app. The purpose was to improve the lives of students, faculty, and staff on campus. In addition, the mobile application would assist visiting students and parents with navigation through the campus to enhance their experience. Unfortunately, because of school's current licensing with a third party vendor, this project did not get to shine as we hoped.

Considering its overall size, the project was rushed in order to finish this prototype. Consequently, the code in this repo is functional but very rough and documentation is incomplete. However, despite the incompleteness, TechHab has agreed to make this a public repo for the sole purpose of education. We hope this will be instrumental for students enrolled in mobile-related courses at, but not limited to, Kalamazoo College.

Although user login is supported, you will not be able to log in as a user without first connecting the project to a database or creating hardcoded users. We have provided the "Guest Mode" login for visiting parents and students, and it serves perfectly for demos as well.

For any bugs or defects that you find, please use the contact provided on the bottom of this page to notify us. However, there is no guarantee in that the reported bug will be fixed in timely manner.
